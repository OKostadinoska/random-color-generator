# Node Random Color Generator

> Generates a random color, optionally based on an input

Without any user input, print random color:

```bash
$ node index.js
Prints random color in a block
```

With user input of a correct color name: print color:
It should be able to not only accept the command itself, but also the request for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)
  ...and then generate random colors that match those choices

```bash
$ node index.js
Prints concrete hue or luminosity in a block
```
